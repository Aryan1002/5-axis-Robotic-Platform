# 5-axis-Robotic-Platform
This project demonstrates a 5-axis robotic arm designed for manual pick-and-place tasks. The robot is controlled using an Arduino and features both a servo motor-based arm mechanism and a motorized base for movement.
5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF): The robotic arm can move along five axes—base, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and gripper—using five servo motors.
Movement Control: The base has four DC motors that allow the robot to move forward, backward, left, and right. These motors are controlled using 2-channel relays.
Servo Motor Driver: The arm's servo motors are powered and controlled through a servo motor driver to ensure smooth and precise movements.
Manual Control: The robot is designed for manual pick-and-place operations, where each movement can be controlled independently using bluetooth module.
